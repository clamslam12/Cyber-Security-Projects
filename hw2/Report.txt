LAN Setup

kali1(main): IP = 192.168.10.129, netmask 255.255.255.0
kali2(clone): IP = 192.168.10.130, netmask 255.255.255.0

Port scanner is ran on kali2 and port scanner detector is ran on kali1.
Both kali vm were on LAN with network adapter set on vmnet5(host only)

Discussion

For the IPlayer function, I used the ip header object and saved its source ip and target ip to an array. I tried to used srcIp as key but dictionary does not allow duplicate keys. 
Timestamp may work for keys but too long. Ideally the source ip are the keys and for each source ip, the values are the target ip and target port.
I saved tcp ports from the tcp header in an array. While using the port scanner all tcp ports were closed and all udp ports were opened. However
using the port scanner detector, only the tcp header was present on the console when trying to debug so I only saved the tcp header and its ports.
As for the results, if the fan-out rate per sec exceeds 5, or the fan-out rate per minute exceeds 100, or the fan-out rate per 5min exceeds 
300 (any of these), the source IP is identified as a port-scanner. Port scanner detected on source ip 192.168.10.130 and average fan-out rate per
second is 1691, average fan-out rate per min is 101484, average fan-out rate per 5 minutes is 507444 and the reason for port scanner detection is
the average fan-out rate per second is 1691.
